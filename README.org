** Setting soft limits on FMBO motors

There is a bit of misdirection in how limits are set.  Doing something
like ~caput XF:06BMA-OP{Mono:DCM1-Ax:Bragg}Mtr.LLM -1~ will be a
temporary fix, only until the next time save-restore triggers.

Instead, do ~caput XF:06BMA-OP{Mono:DCM1-Ax:Bragg}Mtr_LLM_SP -1~.
This will save the ~_LLM_SP~ value in save-restore.  Setting ~_LLM_SP~
sets the ~.LLM~ value, as seen in
~/opt/epics/modules/SAI/db/SAI_MotorRecord.template~.

The same goes for the ~.HLM~ fields of the FMBO motors.

Similarly, it is unhelpful to save ~.LLM~ or ~.HLM~ fields in
save-restore.  Doing so seems to put the motor in a confused state
with respect to it relation to soft limits.

** Some useful commands

Command for tar-ing up all the iocs and excluding revision control dot folders:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo tar --exclude='*/.bzr/*' --exclude='*/.hg/*'  -cvf all_iocs.tar cam* F460 I400 MC0* pi* plc1 softIocCommon va-1
#+END_SRC

** 2nd Xtal Roll encodeer loss

 - mc02-11Jan2018.cfg :: MC02 configuration prior to encoder loss event
 - mc02-12Jan2018.cfg :: MC02 configuration as modified by Graeme
      Elliner to use steps rather than encoder counts
