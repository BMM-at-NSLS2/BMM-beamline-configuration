== Hutch search sign ==

These instructions are printed, laminated, mounted on a magnetic sheet, and hung near the search station. I would like to make these signs in various languages. If you would like to help by translating this sign, download the Word document below. Make a translation into your language and mail the Word doc back to Bruce. He will print and mount the new translation! I am most eager for Chinese, Russian, and German translations.
