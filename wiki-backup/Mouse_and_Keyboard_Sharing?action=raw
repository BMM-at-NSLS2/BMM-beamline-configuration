The Synergy server runs on xf06bm-ws1.&nbsp; To start the server type
<pre>synergys -d WARNING &</pre>

at the command line.&nbsp; This will read the Synergy configuration file at <tt>/etc/synergy.conf</tt>. The <code>-d</code> flag sets the logging level to filter out INFO level messages in <tt>/var/log/syslog</tt>.&nbsp; This helps the responsiveness on the client side.

On xf06bm-ws2, start the client by typing this at the command line:
<pre>synergyc xf06bm-ws1 &</pre>

Both of those command have to be run as the user logged in.&nbsp; That is, the user running the synergy commands has to be the one with control of the respective X sessions.

<span style="color:#A9A9A9">On xf06bm-ws3, do ''something something''</span>

The screen layout looks something like this (ws3 not actually in use):
<pre>             +----------+
+----------+ |  ws1-m2  |
|    ws2   | +----------+
+----------+ |  ws1-m1  | 
             +----------+ 
</pre>

To move the mouse between keyboards, simply run the mouse up or to the left or right.&nbsp; It will magically pass from machine to machine.&nbsp; The keyboard will respond to whatever window is under the mouse.
