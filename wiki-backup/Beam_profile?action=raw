== Unfocused beam ==

Here is the beam profile measured at the XAS station and at 11 keV. This was measured by rastering a 0.125 pinhole through the beam.&nbsp; The plot shows <code>1000*It/I0</code>.&nbsp; Note the computed horizontal structure of the beam shows through -- the instensity distribution is bimodal with peaks at about +/- 4.5 mm from the center.[[File:Pinhole.jpg|thumb|right|150px|125 &mu;m pinhole, rastered in front of beam]]
