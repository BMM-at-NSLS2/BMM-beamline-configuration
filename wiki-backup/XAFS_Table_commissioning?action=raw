The various energy and mirror configurations of the beamline lead to a distribution of heights and inclinations as the beam approaches the XAFS table. To meet all these various operating modes, the hieght of the DCM must match the beam height.&nbsp; Also, the height and pitch of the XAFS table must match the beam.&nbsp; This allows the ionization chambers to be set at fixed heights (relative to the table surface).

Here we show the positions of DM3 at the two extreme orientations.

*Energy below 8 keV
*Toroidal focusing mirror around 3.5 mRad
*Flat harmonic rejection mirror at 5 mRad

== Mode D/E ==
